# Widgets are user interface elements that you add to your program to 
# provide some kind of functionality. They may or may not be visible. 
#Examples would be a file browser, buttons, sliders, lists and so on. 
#Widgets receive MotionEvents.

# You use layouts to arrange widgets. 
#It is of course possible to calculate your widgetsâ€™ positions yourself, 
# but often it is more convenient to use one of our ready made layouts. 
# Examples would be Grid Layouts or Box Layouts. You can also nest layouts.
